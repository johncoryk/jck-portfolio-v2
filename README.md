# Portfolio Website for Cory Kelley (johncoryk)

This is the second iteration of my portfolio website. On it you will find a list of recent projects and projects that I enjoyed working on. My portfolio site also tells a bit about me, tools I use, and how you can reach out to me if you wish.

## Tools used to build my portfolio site:

- Gatsby
- SCSS/Modules
- VSCode for coding
- Contentful for my blog CMS (though it may or may not be present on the current version of the site)
